In creation of this program we used the FibLFR.h and FibLFR.cpp files to preform a random 8 bit shift.
For this program we developed a encryption and decryption methord for encrypting png files. To accomplish this we ask the user
to input a seed(which is random 16 binary number). We then generate a new 8 bit int by using the generate function we developed
last time. XORing that with the rbg values of each pixels will change the content and hide the content.I got help from shivy and the only problems 
i faces was the make file.
